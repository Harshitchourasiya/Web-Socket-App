###### Socket APP

## What is Web-Socket?
A protocol that provides full-duplex(multiway) communication i.e allows communication in both directions simultaneously. It is a modern web technology in which there is a continuous connection between the userâ€™s browser(client) and the server. In this type of communication, between the web server and the web browser, both of them can send messages to each other at any point in time.

In Simple words, It is needed for snerios where client do not need to request for the resources and where the server is capable of sending the requried resourse without any request.

## Dependency used

It is a JS libray for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

Babel

Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser (even the old ones).
Babel is responsible to converting new language features to old. You can write code that would run on many browser by using just the bundler but without using Babel. You code does become more convoluted by transpiling it with Babel, so you should only do this if you need to.
